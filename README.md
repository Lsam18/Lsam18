## 💼 Work Experience (Real & Simulated)

### 🔍 Cyber Threat Intelligence Analyst (Contract) – NOVAIZE (2025–Present)
- Integrated threat intel feeds (AlienVault OTX, AbuseIPDB, PhishTank) into Sentinel watchlists.
- Correlated IOC data with geo, ASN, and passive DNS records for enriched alerting.
- Mapped detections to MITRE ATT&CK using automated tagging scripts.
- Led weekly threat landscape reports with IOC bundles, malware families, and detection efficacy insights.

### 🛡️ SOC Engineer Intern – MillenniumIT ESP (2024)
- Wrote custom detection rules for Azure Sentinel and FortiSIEM, boosting fidelity by 35%.
- Integrated Bash/Python automation into SOC alert triage pipelines.
- Created dashboards that visualized RDP attack trends and internal privilege escalations.
- Reduced false positives by 25% through log optimization and baseline normalization.
