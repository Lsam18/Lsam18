Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Ethical Hacking | SIEM & Threat Hunting

I‚Äôm a final-year Cybersecurity student at NSBM Green University, affiliated with the University of Plymouth, graduating in 2025. I‚Äôm passionate about solving security challenges and uncovering hidden details. My experience includes penetration testing, password cracking, network traffic analysis (Wireshark, Snort), and Digital Forensics for investigating incidents.

During my internship at MillenniumIT ESP, I gained hands-on experience with SIEMs like Azure Sentinel and FortiSIEM, optimizing log analysis workflows and using KQL to turn raw security data into actionable insights. I‚Äôm driven by both the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity, always striving to stay one step ahead of evolving threats.

Currently, I‚Äôm gaining practical experience at a startup developing an AI-powered threat detection engine, where I‚Äôm involved in cutting-edge projects to build smarter, faster detection systems.

Outside of work, I‚Äôm actively involved in the FOSS Community and the NSBM Islamic Society, where I collaborate with like-minded individuals to share ideas and grow together.

My long-term goal is to build my own cybersecurity company, developing innovative solutions to tackle the ever-growing landscape of cyber threats. If you're passionate about cybersecurity or tackling real-world security challenges, let‚Äôs connect!

## Objective
I hold various certifications, including SSCP (Coursera), Google Cybersecurity, Security Blue Team Pathway, and IBM Cybersecurity Analyst Professional. My areas of expertise include web development, C# .NET Framework, Digital Forensics, Darkweb Operations, and problem-solving. Passionate about utilizing technology for humanitarian impact, I aspire to a future role as CTO/CIO/CISO.

## Currently Working On

üî≠ **Hybrid SIEM with Cloud and Local Honeypot
Integration** (November 2024 to Present)

Critical flaws in the Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems that are currently
in use are addressed by the proposed project, Hybrid SIEM with Cloud and Local Honeypot
Integration. The project uses a hybrid strategy to combine local and cloud-based honeypots into a
single monitoring environment. This integration offers strong threat detection and response
capabilities by using Azure Sentinel for centralised logging and machine learning to identify
anomalies.
